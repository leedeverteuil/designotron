# Designotron
> A tool for getting web design inspiration quickly.

I made a tool using [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) that allows you to quickly interchange screenshots of website sections.

Potential use cases:
- Getting quick inspiration when you're not really feeling creative
- Seeing what's popular in web design at the moment
